## Side Note 

During my time here, I've had the pleasure of meeting awesome poolers and students. It's been a unique experience, though I've encountered a few interesting characters along the way. Overall, the Pool offers a 30-day intense, hands-on, low-level learning experience that every developer should undertake.
